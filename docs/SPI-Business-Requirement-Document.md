### Background Purpose

### Executive Summary
To begin, you’ll need to create an executive summary that provides an overview of the organization and the challenges facing the business. You’ll explain the issues and what the organization is trying to achieve to ensure everyone is on the same page. This section should be short, like an elevator pitch, summarizing the rest of the business requirements document.

### Project Description/Objectives
After summarizing the issue you plan to address in the project, you’ll want to clearly define the project’s objective. This helps define the project phases, creates a way to identify solutions for the requirements of the business and the customer, gains consensus from stakeholders and the project team and describes how you arrived at the objectives.

### Use Case: Follow SIPOC Model (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs and Customers)
- S: Actor/Persona
- I: Action
- P: Application/System/Process
- O: Result
- C: End User

### Design Thinking:
- Empathise
- Experience
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test
- Implement
- Demo
- Retro
- Feedback

### Analysis
- SWOT Analysis - SWOT is an acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. The analysis utilizes these headings in a quadrant format (Fig. 1) to list core competencies and other relevant company traits and characteristics. It’s a visual tool to help you see how the company is currently positioned and provides insight on what areas the company should be addressing in the near the future.
- Business Driver: 
- Business Justification: 
- Cost-Benefit Analysis: You’ll also want to do a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the costs associated with the project are worth the benefits you’ll get. This requires first determining the associated costs of the project, such as upfront development costs, unexpected costs, future operating costs and tangible and intangible costs. You’ll also need to figure out what benefits derive from the project.
- ROI Analysis : Return on Investment
- Data Analysis: 

### Solution Sketch
- Current State
- Proposed State
- Future State

### Project Scope
- Assumptions:
- Constraints: At this point, you’ll want to explore the project constraints. Define the limitations of the project and share those with the project team so they know of any obstacles earlier than later. In order for them to clear those hurdles, you’ll want to provide any necessary training or allocate resources to help the project stay on track.
- In Scope:The project scope should define in detail what is covered in the project and what would make it run out of scope. This creates a clear boundary for the project and allows stakeholders and teams to agree on the business goals and high-level outcomes. Note what problems are being addressed, the boundaries for implementing the project and the expected return on investment (ROI).
- Out of Scope: The project scope should define in detail what is not covered in the project

### Requirements
- Epic Stories
- Application Features:
- Functional Requirements/User Stories: Here you’ll want to list the business requirements or critical activities that must be completed to meet the organization’s objectives. These business requirements should meet both stakeholder and customer needs. This can include a process that must be completed, a piece of data that is needed for the process or a business rule that governs that process and data.
- Non-Functional Requirements/Tasks:

### 
- Test Cases
- Issues and resolutions
- Treaceability Matrix: of all above


### Team:

- Key Stakeholders: Now you’ll want to identify and list the key stakeholders in the project. Once you have that list, assign roles and responsibilities to each. These might be people outside of your department so you should define their role in the success of the project. This information needs to be distributed in order for everyone to know what’s expected of them in the project. You can even use this section to assign tasks.
