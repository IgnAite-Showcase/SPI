Funding Phases 

 

Phase 

Description 

 

Seed Funding 

The initial capital used to prove a concept, conduct market research, and develop a prototype. This funding often comes from friends and family, angel investors, or early-stage venture capitalists. 

 

Series A 

Once a startup has demonstrated 	viability, generated initial traction, and has a developed product or service, it may seek Series A funding. This round is often used to scale operations, expand market reach, and 	improve products 

 

Series B 

 

This stage comes after Series A and 	is aimed at helping a company grow and meet market demand at a larger scale. Companies at this 	stage often have a proven business model and need funds to expand further. 

 

Series C,D,E,F 

 

Subsequent funding rounds, each designed to support a company's continued 		growth, market dominance, and potentially international expansion. As companies progress through these rounds, they are expected to have a solid customer base and be closer to profitability. 

 

 

IOP (Initial Public Offering) 

 

Going public through an IPO means the 		company's shares are offered to the public for the first time on a stock exchange. This allows the company to raise 		significant capital from a wide range of investors.
