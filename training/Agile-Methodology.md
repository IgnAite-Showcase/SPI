### 1. Product Backlog Building (BA and PM)
1. Introduce Product Idea (BAP)
2. Design Thinking - Empathise:  Persona
3. Design Thinking - Define : Problem Statement
4. Design Thinking - Ideation: Refine Final Idea
5. Backlog Development - High Level(Epic -> Feature)
6. Backlog Development - Execution Level (User Stories).
   E.g. Story: As a Admin I would like to have forms and screens to manage "Users" 
8. Backlog Development - Story Work Breakdown Structure (User Story -> Tasks)
   E.g. Tasks Categories (Business Analyst, Backend, Frontend, Testing)
9. Task Sizing - Define size of task (Small, Medium, Large) depend on Complexity
10. ***Deliverable: Prepare Task Backlog within GitHub Task Board***
   E.g. Define tasks for Users Reports and Forms (Business Analyst, Backend, Frontend, Testing)

### 2. Sprint Planning (E.g. Sprint #0)
1. Theme: BAP Prototype Development - Learn Apex
2. Type: Vertical (Deep in few Features), Horizontal (All Features)
3. Scope: Identify Stories and Tasks relevat tp Theme or PM Demand
4. Velocity: Individual Availability and Capacity in Hrs/Points
5. Assignment: Assign Each Task to only one Individual
6. Commitment: Get overall commitment from Agile team on Sprint# Deliverable

### 3. Sprint Execution
1. Individual Assignment: Refer assigned Task Backlog within GitHub Task Board
2. Refine assignment: Clarify Tasks and refine any details and provide Comments.
   E.g. Define tasks for Users Reports and Forms (Business Analyst, Backend, Frontend, Testing)
3. Develpment: Perfom Development Task will go from (To Do -> In Progress -> Done)
- ***BA Design Task:*** Identify Features/Component, Define Navigation and Breadcrumb Menu, Assign task in GitHub
- ***Backend Task:*** Data Structure Modeling Scripts (Tables, Columns, Sequences, Triggers, Views, Inserts, API
- ***Frontend Task:*** Define Report, Define Data Entry Form and Link Report with the Navigation and Breadcrumb Menu
- ***Testing Task:*** Test Navigation, Reports, Forms, and API

### 4. Demo and Retro
1. Demonstrate Application to the Product Manager
2. Feebcack on Application Demonstration
3. Retrpspective: What went well and What did not go well.
